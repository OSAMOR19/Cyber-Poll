# decentralized-voting-webapp
This is a repository for Block-Chain Based Voting Application. We aim at tackling the issues faced in modern day voting by coming up with the 
Electronic Voting system, providing the users a much more transparent and free election.
We hope this idea can be implemented in the future.
